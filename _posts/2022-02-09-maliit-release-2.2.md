## What is it?

Maliit provides a flexible and cross-platform input method framework. It has a
plugin-based client-server architecture where applications act as clients and
communicate with the Maliit server via input context plugins. Maliit is an open
source framework (LGPL 2.1 or later) and an open source on-screen keyboard (LGPL 3.0 only).

Maliit is being used by [KDE for Plasma](https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2021/03/using-maliit-keyboard-in-a-plasma-wayland-session/),
[LG for webOS](https://github.com/webosose/maliit-framework-webos),
[Ubuntu Touch](https://gitlab.com/ubports/core/lomiri-keyboard),
[LuneOS](https://github.com/webOS-ports/webos-keyboard),
[Sailfish OS](https://git.sailfishos.org/mer-core/maliit-framework),
and likely others.

Visit [maliit.github.io](/) for more information about the project.

## Call for contributions

Maliit's website could benefit from a little love. Some of the information is
no longer up to date.
If anybody out there has some time to spare to fix it up a little bit, hop to
[github.com/maliit/maliit.github.io](https://github.com/maliit/maliit.github.io) and send us a pull request.

Should anybody with some influence at Canonical happen to read this announcement:
We have nothing against the LGPL 3.0 but we'd like some consistency in our
licensing. Maliit Keyboard was originally BSD-licensed but Canonical code from 2014
until 2017 is licensed under LGPL-3.0-only. If Canonical could send us a PR
replacing the LGPL 3.0 headers with BSD ones, we'd appreciate it.

We currently lack the manpower to crawl through various forks of Maliit Framework
and Keyboard. We're aware of them and we totally support the right of anybody
to fork all Free Software code but not always is new code in those forks specific
to custom implementations. A helping hand or two that ports improvements useful
for our upstream code would, again, be very appreciated.
