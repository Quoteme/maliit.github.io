We forked the abandoned ubuntu-keyboard (which was originally based on maliit-plugins), removed the Ubuntu dependencies
and pushed it into a new [maliit-keyboard repository](https://github.com/maliit/keyboard).

It supports language layouts: Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bosnian, Catalan, Chinese (Pinyin), Chinese (Chewing), Czech, Danish,
German, Greek, English, Esperanto, Spanish, Persian, Finnish, French, Gaelic, Hebrew, Croatian, Hungarian, Icelandic,
Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Norwegian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Serbian, Swedish,
Ukrainian and an Emoji layout. The non-cjk languages support text prediction/correction via presage and hunspell.

It is the new default keyboard for Maliit.
